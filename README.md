# lidar_align

## A simple method for finding the extrinsic calibration between a 3D lidar and a 6-dof pose sensor
The method makes use of the property that pointclouds from lidars appear more 'crisp' when the calibration is correct. It does this as follows:
1) A transformation between the lidar and pose sensor is set.
2) The poses are used in combination with the above transformation to fuse all the lidar points into a single pointcloud.
3) The sum of the distance between each point and its nearest neighbour is found.
This process is repeated in an optimization that attempts to find the transformation that minimizes this distance.

## Installation

To install lidar_align, please install [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu), [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) or [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu).

First install additional system dependencies (swap kinetic for indigo or melodic as necessary):
```
sudo apt-get install python-wstool python-catkin-tools libnlopt-dev
```

Next, add a few other dependencies.
If you don't have a catkin workspace yet, set it up as follows:
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin init
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/kinetic #swap kinetic for your ros version
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
catkin config --merge-devel
```

If using [**SSH keys for github**](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) (recommended):
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone git@github.com:ethz-asl/lidar_align.git
wstool init . ./lidar_align/lidar_align_ssh.rosinstall
wstool update
```

If **not using SSH** keys the same process can be performed using https instead:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/lidar_align.git
wstool init . ./lidar_align/lidar_align_https.rosinstall
wstool update
```

If you have already initalized wstool replace the above `wstool init` with `wstool merge -t`

Compile:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
catkin build voxblox_ros
```


## Estimation proceedure
For most systems the node can be run without tuning the parameters. By default two optimizations are performed, a rough global optimzation followed by a local refinement.

The node will load all messages of type `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` from the given ROS bag for use as the lidar scans to process. The poses can either be given in the same bag file as `geometry_msgs/TransformStamped` messages or in a seperate CSV file that follows the format of [Maplab](https://github.com/ethz-asl/maplab).

## CSV format

| Column | Description |
|--:|:--|
1 | timestamp ns 
2 | vertex index (not used) 
3 | position x
4 | position y
5 | position z 
6 | orientation quaternion w 
7 | orientation quaternion x
8 | orientation quaternion y 
9 | orientation quaternion z 

Note that Maplab has two CSV exporters. This file-format is the same as produced by [exportPosesVelocitiesAndBiasesToCsv](https://github.com/ethz-asl/maplab/blob/master/console-plugins/vi-map-data-import-export-plugin/src/export-vertex-data.cc#L39) but differs from the output of [exportVerticesAndTracksToCsv](https://github.com/ethz-asl/maplab/blob/master/tools/csv-export/src/csv-export.cc#L35)
