# lidar_align

## A simple method for finding the extrinsic calibration between a 3D lidar and a 6-dof pose sensor
The method makes use of the property that pointclouds from lidars appear more 'crisp' when the calibration is correct. The system attempts to find the transform between a lidar and the given poses such that the distance between any two lidar points in the resulting fused pointcloud is minimized. Currently only supports poses provided by Maplab.

This library is pretty new and only tested on a couple of datasets, so expect some issues when you first run it.

## Estimation proceedure
The estimation is usually performed in two stages.

* First set `local` to `false` and `range` to encompass all sane values for example `[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 3.2, 3.2, 3.2, 0.1]` will explore all rotations, plus all translations within 0.5m. The result of this optimization will get you in the ballpark but will most likely have significant error.
* Secondly take the solution from above and use this to set the `inital_guess`, then rerun with `local` set to true and a smaller range for example `[0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.01]`.

### Scan Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --------------------  |:-----------:| :-------:|
| `min_point_distance` |  Minimum range a point can be from the lidar and still be included in the optimization. | 0.0 |
| `max_point_distance` |  Maximum range a point can be from the lidar and still be included in the optimization. | 100.0 |
| `keep_points_ratio` |  Ratio of points to use in the optimization (runtimes increase drastically as this is increased). | 0.01 |
| `min_return_intensity` | The minimum return intensity a point requires to be considered valid. | -1.0 |
| `motion_compensation` |  If the movement of the lidar during a scan should be compensated for. | true |
| `estimate_point_times` | Uses the angle of the points in combination with `lidar_rpm` and `clockwise_lidar` to estimate the time a point was taken at. | false |
| `lidar_rpm` | Spin rate of the lidar in rpm, only used with `estimate_point_times`. | 600 |
| `clockwise_lidar` | True if the lidar spins clockwise, false for anti-clockwise, only used with `estimate_point_times`. | false |

### IO Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Default |
