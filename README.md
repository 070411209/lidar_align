# lidar_align

## A simple method for finding the extrinsic calibration between a 3D lidar and a 6-dof pose sensor
The method makes use of the property that pointclouds from lidars appear more 'crisp' when the calibration is correct. The system attempts to find the transform between a lidar and the given poses such that the distance between any two lidar points in the resulting fused pointcloud is minimized. Currently only supports poses provided by Maplab.

This library is pretty new and only tested on a couple of datasets, so expect some issues when you first run it.

## Parameters
------

### Scan Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --------------------  |:-----------:| :-------:|
| `min_point_distance` |  Minimum range a point can be from the lidar and still be included in the optimization. | 0.0 |
| `max_point_distance` |  Maximum range a point can be from the lidar and still be included in the optimization. | 100.0 |
| `keep_points_ratio` |  Ratio of points to use in the optimization (runtimes increase drastically as this is increased). | 0.01 |
| `motion_compensation` |  If the movement of the lidar during a scan should be compensated for. | false |
| `lidar_rpm` | Spin rate of the lidar in rpm, only used with `motion_compensation`. | 600 |
| `clockwise_lidar` | True if the lidar spins clockwise, false for anti-clockwise, only used with `motion_compensation`. | false |

### IO Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --------------------  |:-----------:| :-------:|
| `use_n_scans` |  Optimization will only be run on the first n scans of the dataset. | 2147483647 |
| `input_bag_path` |  Path of rosbag containing sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 messages from the lidar. | N/A  |
| `input_csv_path` |  Path of csv generated by Maplab, giving poses of the system to calibrate to. | N/A |
| `output_pointcloud_path` |  If set, a fused pointcloud will be saved to this path as a ply when the calibartion finishes. | "" |
| `output_calibration_path` |  If set, a text document giving the final transform will be saved to this path when the calibration finishes. | "" |

### Alinger Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --------------------  |:-----------:| :-------:|
| `local` |  True for local optimization, false for a much slower global optimization | true |
| `inital_guess` |  Inital guess to the calibration (x, y, z, rotation vector, time offset) | [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] |
| `range` |  Range around the inital guess the optimizer will search for a solution in | [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.15, 3.15, 3.15, 0.0] |
| `max_evals` | Maximum number of function evaluations to run | 1000 |
| `xtol` | Tolerance of final solution | 0.000001 |
| `knn_batch_size` | Number of points to send to each thread when finding nearest points | 1000 |
| `knn_k` | Number of neighbours to consider in error function | 1 |
| `knn_max_dist` | Error between points is limited to this value | 0.1 |
| `time_cal` | True to perform time offset calibration | false |
